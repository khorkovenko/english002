# Getting Started with LinguaPilot App

## Basic prompts for learning a word, a rule, a topic:

### Learn Word

1) Create a 5-question quiz using the given word. Each question should provide 4 answer options: 3 antonyms and 1 synonym, randomly ordered. Present the first question and wait for the user to input their answer (variant 1–4). After each answer, show the next question until all 5 are completed. At the end, provide feedback showing the total score and highlight any questions the user answered incorrectly, including the correct answers for each.

2) Create a speaking exercise using the given word, allowing reading if needed. Generate a dialogue in multiple pieces: Piece A and Piece B. I should provide my answer either in writing or spoken form. Evaluate my response by estimating how close I am to a fluent speaker, including accent, clarity, thought formulation, and how well I express ideas in English. Provide detailed written feedback, including suggestions on how to reformulate sentences for more natural or fluent English, and then ask if I want to continue. If I respond with “y,” generate the next piece of the dialogue.

### Learn Rule

1) Create an English sentence completion game using grammar rules. Provide the first or second part of a sentence, requiring me to finish it using 1 or 2 specific grammar rules. At higher levels, multiple rules may apply, and the “correct” answer may not strictly follow the simplest rule. Present the sentence part and wait for my input. After my response, give detailed feedback on correctness, rule usage, and naturalness. If my answer is correct, ask if I want to move to a higher level. If I respond with “y,” generate slightly harder sentences and increment the difficulty, starting from level 1.

2) Create a Java coding exercise meant to be completed in an IDE. Provide a request to write a function in the main class that applies a specific rule, along with a template of the class including public static void main(String[] args). Include some System.out.println statements that invoke this function with example arguments and show the expected output format, such as System.out.println(yourFunc(arg1) + " for arg1 correct answer - ans1, you got - " + yourFunc(arg1));. Ensure the examples illustrate the correct answer and help the learner verify their implementation.

3) Create a Java exercise where the main class includes a completed function that applies the provided rule, with detailed comments explaining the code. Include breakpoint pointers in comments showing why each System.out.println or output behaves as expected. Then, request the learner to write 5 test methods in a separate test package to test this function, ensuring each test covers different scenarios or edge cases.

### Learn Topic

1) Create an exercise to master a new topic through discussion. Assume you are a professional in this field. Start by sharing a recent news item or development from this area, then ask me a question about it. I will answer in English, and you should carefully listen to my response, providing detailed feedback on my accent, clarity, and how I formulate and express my thoughts. If my answer is unclear or heavily accented, request that I repeat it and explain which parts of my speech were most accented and how to improve them. After feedback, ask the next question based on my answer. Continue this interactive discussion loop until I indicate that I want to ask my own questions.

2) Describe how your day was in English, speaking or writing freely and including as many details as possible about what you did, how you felt, and any notable events. After you finish, I will provide detailed feedback on your fluency, thought formulation, vocabulary choices, grammar, pauses, and accent, explaining how clearly and naturally you expressed your ideas. I may also ask follow-up questions to continue the discussion and help you improve your English expression.

## Quick Prompts for Explaining

These prompts help you understand and explain words, rules, and topics in depth.

### Explain Word

1. **Short Story**  
   Create a short story (maximum 30 words) that explains the given word by using it naturally in context. The meaning should be clear for a non-native English speaker.

2. **Translation & Synonyms**  
   Provide a direct English translation of the given word or phrase. Include 3–5 English synonyms, ordered from the most commonly used to the least commonly used.

3. **Antonyms**  
   Provide 3–5 English antonyms for the given word, ordered from the most commonly used to the least commonly used.

### Explain Rule

1. **HTML Table**  
   Create an HTML table using only the `<table>` tag with inline styles (no CSS classes or external styles). The table should clearly explain the given rule or concept (it can be about English, Java, Physics, or any subject) and include multiple examples demonstrating the rule or concept in context. The table layout should be responsive and adaptive for different screen sizes.

### Explain Topic

1. **Simple Description Table**  
   Create an HTML table using only the `<table>` tag with inline styles. The table should provide a simple description of the given topic, explain what it is, and list key words related to the topic that learners should know. The table should be clear, readable, and adaptive for different screen sizes.

2. **Detailed Description Table**  
   Create an HTML table using only the `<table>` tag with inline styles. The table should provide a detailed description of the given topic, explain what it is, and list key words related to the topic that learners should know. The table should be clear, readable, and adaptive for different screen sizes.
